    <h2 style="text-align: center;">How to use</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">- There are 3 ways to download:<br />+ Click on the popup icon on the top-right and
        make your choice.<br />+ Right-click on the timeline of a post or comment and choose <strong>Download This
            Video</strong><br />+ Click the button present on each video (accuracy is about 85%)<br />- You can download
        the video by URL, to download the video based on the current URL, click the popup of the extension and select
        <strong>Download Current URL</strong> or<strong> right-click </strong>on the page&nbsp;and choose
        <strong>Download This Video</strong>.<br />However, to be able to download the video correctly,
        <strong>right-click</strong> on the timeline of the post or comment including that video and choose
        <strong>Download This Video</strong> from the menu or you can click on that link, it will take you to the post
        or video and choose <strong>Download Current URL</strong>&nbsp;from the popup or <strong>Download This
            Video</strong> from right-click menu.<br />- The displayed button may be inaccurate and quite annoying, you
        can disable the button by clicking on it and selecting Hide or open the popup and select the
        <strong>Setting</strong> section to disable this feature. I recommend clicking the timeline of the post or
        comment to download the video instead of relying on the button too much.<br />- There are 3 ways to download,
        now to download method, there are 2 download methods:<br /> <strong>+ Download by
            default</strong><br /><strong>+ Get Video quality</strong><br />- Download by default will choose
        <strong>the highest quality video with sound</strong> if any, some videos sometimes used by this download are
        not good quality because <strong>the highest quality video often doesn't have sound</strong>, you can choose
        <strong>Get Video Quality</strong> instead.<br /> - Get Video quality helps you to choose videos and audio with
        different quality, but for video without HD or SD mark(like 1080P, 720P), <strong>there will be no
            sound</strong>, but you can choose 'Merge Video + Audio' to combine video and audio together, you can also
        trim the video as you like by selecting 'Edit'.</p>
